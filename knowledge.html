                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>
                    This portfolio is a collection of work samples, examples and information that showcase my skills, abilities and achievements. <br><br>
                    Creating this portfolio in HTML is about coding and designing my website, which contains all the elements of my current learning process. <br> <br>
                    The process usually involves creating a home page, adding text and images to represent different projects, and creating
                    links to other pages within the portfolio website.

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>
                    CSS has allowed me to specify the appearance and behaviour of HTML elements such as fonts, colours,and layout <br><br>
                    When designing my portfolio, I used CSS to create a visually appealing interface. 
                    I used CSS to define the font, colour, background and other visual elements that make up my portfolio. <br><br>
                    I also used CSS to define the behaviour of elements, such as how they appear when hovered,and what happens when clicked.
                    <br><br>
                    Using CSS, I also tried to create a responsive design that makes the portfolio look good on any device, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

                <p>üë®‚Äçüíª Update on my Learning Journey! üë®‚Äçüéì
                    I'm thrilled to share that I have already acquired foundational skills in JavaScript and JSON. <br><br><br>In my
                    JavaScript journey, I have grasped the fundamentals of the language, including variables, data types, conditionals,
                    loops, functions, and objects. With these building blocks, I can now create dynamic and interactive web applications.
                    <br><br>Furthermore, I have delved into the world of the Document Object Model (DOM), empowering me to manipulate HTML
                    and CSS elements seamlessly. By harnessing this power, I can bring life to web pages and enhance user experiences.
                    <br><br><br>My journey as a developer continues to evolve, and I'm excited to learn and grow even further. Stay tuned as
                    I delve into new technologies and embark on exciting projects! <br><br>#NeverStopLearning üöÄ
